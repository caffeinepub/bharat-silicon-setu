# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Change all black text to white throughout the application for better visibility against dark backgrounds.

**Planned changes:**
- Update all text colors from black/gray to white in LandingPage.tsx (hero section, problem section, how it works, stakeholder cards, impact metrics)
- Update all text colors from black to white in StudentDashboard.tsx (sidebar, headings, skill tags, project cards, applied projects, mentor messages)
- Update all text colors from black to white in IndustryDashboard.tsx (sidebar, project listings, status indicators, applicant cards, analytics)
- Update all text colors from black to white in AdminDashboard.tsx (sidebar, metrics, revenue data, chart labels, activity feed)
- Update all text colors from black to white in AISkillMapping.tsx (headings, instructions, skill analysis results, match scores)
- Update all text colors from black to white in RoleSelectionModal.tsx (modal title, role card titles and descriptions)

**User-visible outcome:** All text throughout the application displays in white color, providing consistent readability against the dark blue professional theme.
