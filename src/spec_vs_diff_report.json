  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements across student, industry, and admin dashboards. Backend migration, data structures, and query methods are implemented. Frontend pages integrate with backend hooks for real data. However, some minor gaps exist in skill match percentage calculation, application creation flow, and comprehensive date range filtering.",
