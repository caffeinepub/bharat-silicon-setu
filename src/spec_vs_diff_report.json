  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 9 requirements (REQ-14 through REQ-22) for adding Internet Identity authentication. The diff shows comprehensive integration including login button on landing page, role selection modal, backend user profile storage in Motoko, authentication guards for protected routes, logout buttons in dashboards, role-based routing, backend methods for user-specific data storage, and updates to fetch real user data instead of hardcoded values. All acceptance criteria appear to be met with proper error handling and loading states.",
